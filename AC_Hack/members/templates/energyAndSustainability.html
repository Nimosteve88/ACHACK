        <h2>What is Energy and Sustainability?</h2>
        <p>Energy is like the superpower that makes things work â€“ from lights in your home to the gadgets you use. Sustainability is all about using this superpower wisely so that we don't run out and keep our planet healthy.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>Imagine a world where everything is powered by clean and green energy. That's what we're aiming for! Sustainable practices help us protect the environment, save resources, and create a better future for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Easy Ways to Save Energy</h2>
        
            <p><strong>Turn Off Lights:</strong> When you leave a room, switch off the lights to save energy.</p>
            <p><strong>Unplug Chargers:</strong> Chargers still use energy even if they're not charging anything. Unplug them when not in use.</p>
            <p><strong>Go Solar:</strong> Explore using solar power to generate clean energy for your home.</p>
            <p><strong>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:</strong> Minimize waste by recycling and reusing items. It's good for the planet!</p>
        

        <h2>The Power of Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>Renewable energy, like wind and solar power, doesn't run out and doesn't harm the environment. It's our ticket to a sustainable and eco-friendly future.</p>

        <h2>Be an Energy Hero!</h2>
